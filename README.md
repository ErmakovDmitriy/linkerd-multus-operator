# linkerd-multus-operator

This operator manager Multus NetworkAttachmentDefinition resources based on Linkerd AttachDefinition
resources in a Namespace.

The intention is to provide support for Linkerd in Openshift environment.
Openshift uses Multus which does not support CNI chaining, so the CNIs must be called as NetworkAttachmentDefinitions.

## Description

The project defines a CRD [AttachDefinition](api/v1alpha1/attachdefinition_types.go)
which at the moment just shows to the operator that the NetworkAttachmentDefinition must be created.

The operator also provides a mutating webhook to annotate Pods which have `linkerd.io/inject`
annotation with `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation to make Multus call linkerd-cni plugin.

To use this operator a customized linkerd-cni must be deployed in an Openshift cluster from
`https://github.com/ErmakovDmitriy/linkerd2` repository. A build is provided at
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/demonihin/linkerd2-cni).

The only change from the upstream Linkerd CNI is that the customized plugin returns a dummy CNI JSON result,
if nothing is provided from a previous plugin (support to be called as a stand-alone, not chained).

The built container image is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/demonihin/linkerd-multus-operator).

This application should be treated just as a proof of concept.

A future idea is to modify linkerd proxy-injector to support a Pod proxy customizations
based on the AttachDefinition resource which may improve Openshift support because the default
settings (specifically a static ProxyUID) are not allowed by default in Openshift.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/linkerd-multus-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/linkerd-multus-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
